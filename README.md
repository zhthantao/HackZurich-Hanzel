# HackZurich-Hanzel

2016 Hack Zurich project. A mixed reality cardboard application of futuristic shopping experience. 
Initial idea of this project is to run in on a Hololens, but sadly we were not able to organize the hardware needed to develop for the Hololens. Thats why we decided to build a proof of concept in VR which simulates the Hololens behavior, and its interaction with the environment
